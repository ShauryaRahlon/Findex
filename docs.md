# FindexAI Documentation

## Overview

FindexAI is an AI-powered browser extension and platform that transforms the traditional "Ctrl+F" search into a semantic, multi-agent, and vector-based discovery engine. Whether you're searching through long articles, YouTube videos, or live web content, FindexAI leverages advanced language models, vector search, and a modular architecture to help you find information faster and more intelligently.

- **Browser Extension:** Works in Chrome and Firefox, providing an AI chat sidebar and enhanced search capabilities.
- **Backend:** FastAPI-based, modular, and model-agnostic, supporting multiple agents (web, YouTube, HTML) and vector search (FAISS).
- **Frontend:** React-based UI with a powerful theme engine and seamless integration into your browsing workflow.

## Key Features

- **AI Chat Sidebar:** Instantly access an AI-powered chat by pressing a shortcut (e.g., Ctrl+Shift+F).
- **Multi-Agent Architecture:**
  - **Web Search Agent (SearchXNG):** Real-time, up-to-date answers from the web.
  - **YouTube Agent:** Pulls video transcripts and context for deep video search.
  - **HTML Page Agent:** Converts on-page content to Markdown for semantic querying.
- **Vector Similarity Search:** Uses FAISS for lightning-fast retrieval of indexed content.
- **Model-Agnostic Backend:** Plug in OpenAI, Anthropic, local LLMs, or your own API keys (BYOK).
- **Theming Engine:** Choose from MacOS Classic, Ocean Dark/Light, Windows XP, Neobrutal, and more.
- **YouTube UI Injection:** Chat icon overlays player, video ID auto-extracted for context-aware queries.
- **LocalStorage:** Store API keys, theme settings, and model choices securely in your browser.
- **Planned:** Chat history, user authentication, SQLite persistence, and more.

## Backend Architecture

The backend of FindexAI is a modular, FastAPI-based service that powers the AI search, agentic workflows, and data processing for the browser extension and web clients. Here‚Äôs an overview of its structure and operation:

### 1. Core Structure

- **Entrypoint:**  
  The main FastAPI app is defined in `backend/app/main.py`. It sets up CORS, logging, and includes routers for all major API endpoints (video info, subtitles, ask, health, website, crawler).
- **Configuration:**  
  Environment variables and API keys are managed in `backend/app/core/config.py`, supporting flexible deployment and secure key management.
- **LLM Integration:**  
  The backend interfaces with large language models (LLMs) via `backend/app/core/llm.py`. It currently supports Google Gemini, with planned support for OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, and DeepSeek via LangChain.

### 2. API Routing and Agents

- **Routes:**  
  Each major function (e.g., `/ask`, `/video-info`, `/subs`, `/website`, `/crawller`) has its own route module in `backend/app/routes/`. These routes handle requests, validate input, and orchestrate agent workflows.
- **Agents:**  
  The backend is designed around the concept of ‚Äúagents‚Äù‚Äîmodular components that handle specific types of queries:
  - **Web Search Agent:** For real-time web answers.
  - **YouTube Agent:** For extracting and querying video transcripts and metadata.
  - **HTML Page Agent:** For converting web pages to Markdown and enabling deep semantic search.

### 3. Data Models

- **Request/Response Models:**  
  All API endpoints use Pydantic models for request validation and response formatting, found in `backend/app/models/requests/` and `backend/app/models/response/`.
- **YouTube Info Model:**  
  Specialized models (e.g., `YTVideoInfo`) are used for handling video metadata and transcripts.

### 4. Example Workflow: The `/ask` Endpoint

When a user asks a question about a YouTube video:

1. The frontend sends a POST request to `/ask` with the video URL and question.
2. The backend:
   - Validates the request.
   - Extracts the video ID and fetches video info (title, description, transcript, etc.).
   - Passes this context, along with the user‚Äôs question, to the YouTube agent and LLM.
   - Returns a generated answer, along with video metadata, to the frontend.

### 5. Extensibility

- **Model-Agnostic:**  
  The backend is designed to support multiple LLM providers. You can configure which model to use via environment variables.
- **Modular Agents:**  
  New agents can be added for other data sources or workflows.
- **Planned Features:**
  - Vector search (FAISS) for fast retrieval.
  - SQLite for chat history and user data.
  - Authentication and BYOK (Bring Your Own Keys).
